## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Principles applied

1. Lifecycle Hooks: To Specify properties in the created hook itâ€™s very important because the template hasn't mounted yet(making API Request)
2. Components : Vue components are reusable, isolated UI elements.
3. Vue Router : make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze. 
Features include:
Nested route/view mapping
Modular, component-based router configuration
Route params, query, wildcards


### Decisions and Motivations
Below are the decision making process when it comes to implementing the app.
1. Implement the core function of the app requirement
2. Make the website responsive mobile, tablets, desktop
3. Implement Bonus Requirement -> Pagination, search bar, Sort by price and hosting on cloud service

### Tool Selection

1. Vue CLI
2. Vue Router
3. Vuetify
4. Vue JS Devtools for browser

### Time Limit

In the context of this assignment, I did not implement VueX due to time constraint. However given more time, I would definitely implement and refactor the code so that it has the ability to store and share reactive data across the app without trading off performance, testability or maintainability.
